Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce his resignation imminently, a source close to the leader told CNN on Monday.

The first child of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau, Trudeau seems poised to follow in his father’s footsteps, forty years after the elder Trudeau stepped down as prime minister of Canada.

Trudeau first entered the political scene in 2008, when he was elected a member of Parliament, and then as leader of the Liberal Party five years later.

In 2015, he claimed the premiership after he campaigned on an anti-Conservative platform and won a clear majority in the October elections, seeing off his predecessor, Stephen Harper.

One of the country's youngest-ever leaders, Trudeau ascended to popularity by pushing progressive values on the global stage, branding himself as an antidote to former President Donald Trump. He won successive elections in 2019 and 2021.

But his early rise has steadily declined after a series of political setbacks — including accusations of racism after old photographs surfaced of him using blackface and anger over vaccine mandates during the coronavirus pandemic.

He has since slumped in the polls – after incoming US President Trump unleashed a flurry of tariff threats, and the subsequent surprise resignation of his former political ally and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.
